We'll be using EPGP, and I'll provide a short description:
EP = Effort Points, you get these for raiding
GP = Gear Points, you get these for looting items
Priority = the ratio EP divided by GP, so the more you raid the higher it is - the more loot you obtain the lower it is

We'll be using a decay of 10% a week, this decays both GP and EP.
Base\_GP of 150, your GP has this added to it, to avoid dividing by 0.
EP will be earned at a rate of 70 EP every 5minutes on progression fights, and 55 EP/5min on farmed fights.

You might want these addons, but they aren't required:
http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addo ... oaded.aspx - this shows everyone's EP/GP/Priority, and the GP cost of items in tooltips
http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addo ... aster.aspx - this one is used to make looting easier, buttons pop up everytime a boss dies and you can easily need/greed/pass

We'll be using the following distinctions:

Mainspec/Need - upgrade to your main spec
Offspec/Greed - upgrade to an offspec you use in raids that is a different role than your main spec, such as Disarray ret or Rooster resto - NOT a DPS using 2 DPS specs
No one gives a shit about it - this would be things like Seal getting tank gear, or me getting DPS gear

If it is an upgrade (even minor) to your mainspec it will be charged for (even if no one else wants it). Greeds for offspecs will be free, we don't want to penalize players who are helping heal on fights that need it, etc. The items no one wants will also be free, but these have the lowest priority.

We'll use a council system for recipes, legendaries, and possibly very rare items.
